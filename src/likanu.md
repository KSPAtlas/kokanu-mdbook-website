# How To Read Likanu

Likanu is an abugida, meaning that each consonant character always expresses a vowel, and that vowel can be modified with diacritics. The base characters all have an inherent _/a/_ vowel.
- ɞ /ma/
- ɕ /wa/
- ɂ /ja/

To express other vowels, a diacritic is placed to the side of the character.
- ɞı /mi/
- ɞȷ /me/
- ɞſ /mu/
- ɞʃ /mo/

An accent means that syllable ends in a nasal, often referred to as _coda -n_. The accent goes directly over the consonant character.
- ɞ̄ /man/
- ʌ̄ȷ /ten/
- ɞ̄ſ /mun/

Although the vowel diacritic is placed adjacent to the consonant character, almost like an alphabetical letter, this is not an [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet) like you may be used to. A vowel diacritic cannot be used on its own, it can **only** be used to modify the vowel of a consonant character. For words that begin with a vowel sound, the null consonant character ⟨o⟩ must be used and then a vowel diacritic can modify it.
- oʌʃ /ato/
- oıɕȷ /iwe/

It can be helpful for people accustomed to alphabets to consciously try to read each grouping of a consonant character with a vowel diacritic as a single symbol, as one would a letter with a top diacritic.
