# Numbers and Mathematics
Everything you need to know to form large numbers, express time, and even do some basic math. There's quite a lot you can do with just the basic building blocks that Kokanu provides.

It's simple enough to talk about the base number words up to 100 that Kokanu provides: 

$wan - 1 (one)

$ha - 2 (two)

$san - 3 (three)

$nanku - 4 (four)

$lima - 5 (five)

$lijo - 6 (six)

$setan - 7 (seven)

$etu - 8 (eight)

$saka - 9 (nine)

$tiju - 10 (ten)

$sijen - 100 (hundred)

But how do you put these words together to form other numbers? IFor numbers up to 999, it's actually very much like you would do it in English! There is no such thing as a modifier form of a number, they all act as connected nouns. Let's look at examples and it will all be clear.

$tiju $ha - 12 (ten and two)

$etu $tiju - 80 (eight tens)

$san $tiju $ha - 32 (three tens and two)

$lima $sijen $lijo - 506 (five hundreds and six)

Forming Numbers 1000 and larger
-------------------------------

Powers of a thousand (thousand, million, billion, trillion, etc.) are expressed with $con followed by the exponent. For example,

$con $wan - one thousand

$con $ha - one million

$con $san - one billion

$con $nanku - one trillion

It’s important to think of $con to mean “thousand to the power of” or “1000x” rather than just “thousand”. The word $tan is used after each power of a thousand when adding extra numbers.

$nanku $tiju $san $con $wan - 43,000 (\$four tens and three\ $tiju $san $con $wan $tan $wan - 43,001 (\$four tens and three\ $con $ha, $tan $nanku $sijen $nanku $tiju $lijo $con $wan, $tan $setan $tiju $etu - 3,446,078 (\$three\ is used for "zero", though, like in English, it doesn't often appear in compound whole number words. You don't find yourself saying "four thousand, zero hundred, and fifty six", do you? That said, zero is still a very important concept.

Cardinals and Ordinal Numbers
-----------------------------

**Cardinal numbers** are placed **before the noun**. These are used for counting **how many** or **how much** of something there is.

$mi $le $junja $in **$san** **$pawo**. - "I have **three dogs**"

$mi $le $tun **$tiju** **$etu** **$osa** **$minuli**. - "I have been working for **eighteen hours**

**Ordinal numbers** are placed **after the noun**. These are used to specify the position of an item in a series, like "fourth" or "seventeenth".

**$pawo $ha** $le $tope $ani. \- "**The second dog** is the best"

**$san $ten** $putuci $je **$osa** ****$tiju** $etu** $le $conca. - It is 18:03, literally "**three minutes** after the **eighteenth hour** have passed"

This is why when telling time, we say $san $osa to mean "three hours", and "$osa $san" to mean "three o'clock", literally "third hour".

Fractions, Decimals, and Percents
---------------------------------

It's pretty straightforward to talk about whole numbers, but it gets a bit more complicated when you need to discuss numbers with fractional components.

To talk about **fractions** we use \$numerator\ $je \$denominator\ $osa $je $lima - 3/5

$ha $tiju $nanku $osa $je $ha $sijen $san $tiju $wan - 24/231

To talk about **decimals** we use \$whole number\ $ha $pintu $san $ha $nanku $nanku - 12.3244

$san $pintu $wan $nanku $wan $lima $saka $ha... - 3.141592...

To talk about **percentages** we add the phrase **osa je sijen** to the end of the number. This can be combined with decimal notation to specify decimal percentages.

$ha $tiju $lima $osa $je $sijen - 25%

$nanku $tiju $pintu $etu $setan $wan $osa $je $sijen - 40.871%

Negative Numbers
----------------

**Negative numbers** are stated using opotu je \$number\ $je $san - \-3

$opotu $je $nanku $osa $je $tiju - \-4/10

$opotu $je $lijo $pintu $saka $saka - \-6.99

Mathematical Operations
-----------------------

While there are no specific words for mathematical operations such as "addition" or "multiplication", other descriptions can be used to talk about the operations in a mathematical context.

**Operation**

**Kokanu**

Addition

2 + 3

$te $tene $in $san $ke $ha \- literally "to give 3 to 2"

$te $pon $ta $ha $le $unitu $kan $san \- literally "to combine 2 with 3"

2 + 3 = 5

$ha $un $san $le $lima - literally "2 and 3 is 5"

Subtraction

7 - 4

$te $pon $ta $nanku $le $lipan $sun $setan - literally "to make-absent 4 from 7"

$te $alu $in $nanku $sun $setan - literally "to take 4 from 7"

$te $pon $ta $setan $le $papon $in $nanku - literally "to cause 7 to emit 4"

7 - 4 = 3

$setan $un $opotu $nanku $le $san - literally "7 and -4 is 3"

Multiplication

2 \* 5

$te $tun $in $ha $non $je $lima - literally "to create 2 groups of 5"

$te $pon $ta $ha $le $niju $kan $lima - literally "to make-many 2 with 5"

2 \* 5 = 10

$ha $non $je $lima $le $tiju - literally "2 groups of 5 is 10"

$lima $niju $je $ha $le $tiju - literally "5 (large amounts) of 2 is 10"

Division

9 / 4

$te $pon $ta $saka $le $panli $wija $nanku - literally "to cut 9 using 4"

9 / 4 = 2.25

$nanku $panli $je $saka $le $ha $pintu $ha $lima - literally "4 splits of 9 is 2.25"

$saka $osa $je $nanku $le $ha $pintu $ha $lima - stating 9/4 in standard **fraction** form directly

Exponentiation

6³

$te $pon $ta $lijo $le $niju $kan $sa $an $san $ten - literally "to make-many 6 with itself 3 times"

6³ = 216

$san $niju $saman $je $lijo $le $ha $sijen $tiju $lijo - literally "3 identical bunches of 6 is 216"
