# si

This word is used in a unique way that helps facilitate the conversion of words between the different forms.

It's easy enough to say something "is \$a base noun\ $le $len "I am strong"

This only works **if the word is already a base noun or base modifier**. What if it's a **base verb**? How do you say something "is food" or "is edible" using the other derivations of **makan**? You can't say **le makan**, because that means "is eating". What do you do?

The solution is to use the modifier **si** meaning "real" or "existing". As a verb it is used to mean "to be" or "to exist". This allows you to use **modifiers** or **wo**/**je** phrases to use **modifier** or **noun** forms of any word you please.

In linguistics, this "to be" construction is called the $**copula**.

$ne $le **si** $makan "This is edible", literally "This exists edibly"

$ne $le **si** $je $makan "This is food", literally "This exists \$in a manner\ $le $panli "That is divided", referring to the object that has been split

$na $le **si** $je $panli "That is a division", literally "that is dividedness" referring to the split in the object.

This allows you to use the **noun** or **modifier** form of **any word** when saying the phrase "is \$word\ **si** \$word\ **si** $je \$word\ **si** $je \$base modifier\ $le $cenpo, "this is large", than you'd say $ne $le **si** $je $cenpo, "this is largeness". In general this is most useful for using **base verbs** in their **noun** or **modifier** forms.

$Implicit si
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It does feel a bit clunky to be forced to use $le **si** $je to talk about noun forms all the time, so why not cut out a word? The **particle** $je can never be a **verb** itself, but when it comes immediately after $le it can be assumed that the **verb** is implicitly **si**. This shortens $le si $je to simply $le je.

$ne $le **si** $makan - "This is edible"

$ne $le $je $makan - "This is food"

$ja $le $tope $niju - "They are very good"

$ja $le $je $tope $niju - "They are the embodiment of much goodness"

$na $le $panli - "That is divided"

$na $le $je $panli - "That is a division"

This property of implicit **si** is also useful when using prepositions. Instead of saying $na $le **si** $po $tu, "that is for you", you could just say $na $le $po $tu and the **verb** **si** is simply implied.

$matuwa $mi $le $an  $- $"My parent is at the store"

$$kujo $mi $le $nenka $tu - "My sadness is because of you"
