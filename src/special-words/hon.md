# hon

This particle is used to attach context phrases to your sentences. With **hon**, you can place your context in any location within the sentence just like all of the other thematic relation markers. "Context" can be a wide variety of things. We will discuss using this marker for specifying a relative time for the entire sentence, evidentiality, and conditionals. 

### Relative Time

You can use the context marker to provide details about the timing of the event.

$mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi **hon** $lana $minuli - "I ate fruit yesterday"

This could be interpreted as "a few days ago" or "in the past days", interpreting $lana as a plural, but that is often better represented with $niju $lana or $jati $lana.

**hon** $ten $nelo $ne $men $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi "Tonight I will eat fruit", (lit. as for this dark time, I eat fruit)

When time is stated through context, the rest of the verbs are then relative to that time. The thematic relation an can be used for a similar capability.

**hon** $ten $nelo $ne $men $mi $le $makan $minuli $mulu $je $tiju $ten $in $kuwosi "By tonight I will have eaten fruit ten times"

In this example, it doesn't say "tonight I have eaten fruit ten times", which wouldn't make sense because tonight hasn't happened yet. Instead the verb $makan $minuli $mulu is interpreted as if it is already in the future context of "tonight".

**hon** $ten $nelo $minuli $men $mi $le $lo $ke $insu $je $makan - "Last night I went to the restaurant"

Times are not _always_ relative to simple ideas like "today", "tomorrow", or "in three days". Sometimes, you need to talk about something relative to a specific event. For this, we state the context as literally "time that \$event\ $ta \$event\, ..., with the $an preposition dangling. Another option is to use **hon** $ten $je $ta \$event\ $ta $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi $an, $men $mi $le $pasan - "When I eat fruit, I am happy"  
**hon** $ten $ta $mi $le $makan $minuli $in $kuwosi $an, $men $mi $le $pasan - "When I ate fruit, I was happy"

See how when the context is put in the past, the main verb is also interpreted as being past tense, just like the earlier example with **hon** $ten $nelo $ne.

**hon** $ten $ta $mi $le $lo $putuci $ke $insu $ta $le $po $makan $an, $men $mi $le $in $mani $po $kuwosi - "When I go to the grocery store later, I will buy fruit"  
**hon** $ten $je $ta $mi $le $lo $putuci $ke $insu $ta $le $po $makan $an, $men $mi $le $in $mani $po $kuwosi - "When I go to the grocery store later, I will buy fruit"

### Specifying Topics

If providing time as context makes a when-clause, what happens when you provide something that isn't a time? You end up simply specifying a topic. This can be used to introduce a new topic, to specify a relative concept in which to frame the following sentence, or to change topics similar to the English phrase "speaking of which...".

**hon** $pawo $men $mi $le $junja $in $wan, $lekin $jan $tope $mi $le $junja $in $nanku! - "Speaking of dogs, I have one but my friend has four!"

$tu $le $tope **hon** $kanisa $mi - literally "In the context of my thoughts, you are good", or roughly "you are good imo"

This is a somewhat awkward example, as it is more clearly stated using $mi $le $kanisa $ta $tu $le $tope, but it is still correct

**hon** $te $kota $tuntan $je Kokanu $men $tu $o $teka $in $pata $ta $non Kokanu $le $lika. - Roughly, "On the topic of Kokanu grammar, read this guide written by the Kokanu community."

More literally, it's "In the context of speaking Kokanu correctly, you should read this document that the Kokanu community wrote."

**hon** $lantan $ta $le $hunsi $minuli, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "About the car that was red, I am making it blue"

Again, tense is fairly ambiguous here.

### Conditionals

When providing an entire event as context, it is usually interpreted as a conditional ("if \$event\ $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi ... or **hon** $lantan $le $hunsi ...

**hon** $lantan $le $hunsi $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "If the car is red, I will make it blue"

The tense of this sentence is ambiguous.

**hon** $lantan $le $hunsi $minuli $men $mi $le $lun $nile $kate $in $ja - "If the car was red, I would have painted it blue"

Because the context is past tense, the main sentence is interpreted as what would have happened in that hypothetical past.

**hon** $tu $le $ju $ta $le $lo $ke $insu $je $makan $men $mi $le $ju $ta $le $lo $kan $tu - "If you want go to the restaurant, then I want to go with you
