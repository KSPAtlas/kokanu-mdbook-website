# so

The grammar particle **so** means "than", "as", or "compared to".

Comparison
----------

When used with $mese and $menu it creates **comparatives**. Comparatives are phrases like "bigger than", "less cold than", etc., stating **relative** comparisons between things.

$pawo $tu $le $kima $mese **so** $pawo $mi. - "Your dog is **bigger than** my dog"

$mi $le $ju $mese $te $makan **so** $te $antomi. - "I would rather eat than sleep", literally "I want more to eat than to sleep"

Equality/Similiarity
--------------------

Another use of **so** is with $saman “equal/same” and $sone “different” to talk about similarity. This can be combined with $sopa and $cimi, "near" and "specific", to differentiate between things being exactly the same or just similar. Without them, the degree of similarity is implied through context, as is true of so much of Kokanu.

$na $le $saman **so** $ne. \- "That is the **same as** this"

$na $le **$sone** **$niju so** $ne. - "That is **very different than** this"

$pawo $na $le $si $teka $je $saman **$cimi so** $pawo $mi. \- "That dog looks **exactly like** mine"

$tu **so** $ja $le $si $teka $je $saman **$sopa** $la. - "You and him look **similar**!"

Superlatives
------------

Unlike comparatives, **superlatives** state **absolute** comparisons: "best", "most enjoyable", "fastest". For this, you can use the phrase $mese **so** **$ani**, meaning "more than all".

$mi $le $nin $te **$wiki** $mese **so $ani**. - "I am the **fastest** person", literally "I am the person that is **faster than all**"

$mi $le $makan $minuli $mese **so $ani**. - "I ate **the most**"
