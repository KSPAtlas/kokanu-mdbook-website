# lun

Allows intransitive verbs (i.e. verb derivations of **base mods** or **base nouns**) to take an $in argument. The **patient** (value of the $in argument) is the entity that experiences _being_ in the state described by the intransitive verb. This happening is caused by the **agent** or **subject** of the action.

This particle occurs after verb markers $le/$te/$o (and a $no if there is one), and before the **base mod** or **base noun**.

$le **lun X** $in **Y** - "cause **Y** to be **X**" or "**X**\-ify **Y**"

$le **lun** $hunsi $in **Y** - "cause **Y** to be red" or "red-ify **Y**"

Because the point of **lun** is to _enable an $in argument for intransitive verbs (verb derivations of **base mods** or **base nouns**)_, it _**cannot be used on base verbs**_ as they can already take an $in argument (e.g. $le **lun** $makan, $le **lun** $kota, $le **lun** $amo, etc. are all disallowed); $le $pon $ta $le **X** can still be used to achieve causative constructions for **base verbs**.

This particle brings intransitive verbs up to the level of base verbs so that they can both be treated similarly:

$ja $le $pon $ta $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi - "They caused me to eat fruit"

$ja $le $pon $ta $mi $le **lun** $panli $in $kuwosi - "They caused me to split the fruit"

Only links to the **one** content word after it, so adverbs can still follow:

$tu $le **lun** $konpa $wiki $in $tipa - "You quickly shake the container"
