# pijen

Many words in Kokanu, especially **modifiers**, represent **states** rather than **actions**. As seen in the section on $word derivations, the usual **verb** derivation of a **modifier** is "to be \$modifier\ $antomi: "to be sleeping". This allows us to talk about **whether something is or is not in a certain state**, but it doesn't let us talk about **the act of transitioning into that state**. For this we need the verb **pijen**.

If you want to say that something **becomes something else**, using a **noun**, you can use **pijen** $in \$noun\ $le **pijen** $in $ipuwe - "This turns to stone", literally "This becomes of stone"

When using it with a verb, you must use a $te clause.

$mi $le **pijen** $in $te $pen $in $na - "I learn that", literally "I become that (understand that)"

When using **pijen** with a **modifier**, the **modifier** can simply be used in its **verb** form.

$mi $le **pijen** $in $te $antomi - "I **fall asleep**", literally "I **become that (is asleep)sleeply**"
