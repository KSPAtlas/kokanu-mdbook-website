# Using the Parts of Speech

We've learned how to $derive words in the different parts of speech, but we haven't learned how to _recognize_ words in different parts of speech. What makes $makan sometimes mean "to eat", sometimes mean "food" and sometimes mean "edible"? It all has to do with the position of the word in the sentence and what particles, prepositions or preceding content words are present.

Using Verbs
-----------

The most basic particle $le marks the **verb** of a sentence, this can also be known as the "action" of the sentence. Without it, you could only describe things as they are without any change, movement, or activity.

*   $mi $le $makan - "I eat "
*   $tu $le $nin - "You are a person" _(**verb:** to be a person)_
*   $ja $le $canu - "They are cold" _(**verb:** to be cold)_

This can be a bit confusing due to how English uses a helper verb (to be), but it's very important not to get confused thinking $le means "to be".  It only serves to mark the content word following it as being in the verb form. That being said, when **nouns** and **modifiers** are used in their **verb** form, they do include "to be" (called the **copula**) in their definition.

Another thing to note about the above translations, the $le particle alone does not say anything about the tense, such as past ("I was eating"), present ("I am eating"), or future tense ("I will be eating"); or about the aspect, meaning **perfective** (completed action, "I ate"), **continuous** (ongoing action, "I am eating"), or **repeated** (habitual action, "I eat"). These are all valid translations of the sentence **mi le makan**. Which one is meant must be inferred through context.

_If tense and aspect are not clear from the context, there are ways to specify tense and aspect to remove this ambiguity (through verb modifiers)._

### Subject-less sentences

When using $le without a **subject**, the sentence can be inferred to be a statement simply stating that an action is performed.

*   $le $makan $in $kuwosi - "Fruit is eaten"
*   $le $antomi - "Sleep is had", "Being asleep is done", "(it) is asleep" 

In English this sounds a bit awkward, but it is a clearly communicated concept and is completely acceptable in Kokanu. How often you might say such a thing is a different question.

_Additionally, some uses of subject-less sentences are just continuations of an existing implicit subject.Through context, you can determine which style of sentence is in use._

### **Suggested action**

The particle **o** works the same way as $le, marking the **verb**, except that it turns the statement into a **recommendation**, **suggestion**, or what the speaker believes **should** happen.

*   $ja $o $makan $in $kuwosi - "They should eat fruit"
*   $nin $o $tene $in $kuwosi $ke $ja - "Someone should give them fruit"
*   $mi $o $makan $in $ukama... - "I should eat a vegetable..."

### **Subject-less suggestions**

Just as with the $le particle, you can omit the **subject**. Although, with o, a subject-less sentence becomes a **directive** or **command**. 

*   $o $makan $in $kuwosi -  "Eat fruit!"
*   $o $pasan - "Be happy!" a very common phrase used to mean "Welcome!"

Using Nouns
-----------

Typically, a standalone content word functions as a **noun**, such as when it's placed at the start of a sentence (as the **subject**) or when it follows a **thematic relation marker** (as an **object**). Additionally, some verbs take what's called a **direct object** (these are called **transitive** verbs) and you specify the direct object using the preposition **in**.

*   $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi - "I am eating fruit"
*   $tu $le $jatan $in $kiju - "You found a ball"

### **Passive Voice**

There is a subject marking particle men which is only needed if you place the subject in a non-leading position in the sentence. When the subject is the first word, you can omit this particle. Using this sentence form has the effect of emphasizing the action on the direct object and de-empasizing the subject, which effectively provides a form of passive voicing.

*   $in $kuwosi $le $makan  - "the fruit is/was eaten"
*   $in $kuwosi $le $makan $men $pawo - "the fruit is/was eaten by the dog"
*   $in $kiju $le $jatan - "the ball is/was found"
*   $in $kiju $le $jatan $men $mi - "the ball is/was found by me"

**Using Modifiers**
-------------------

**Modifiers** are called an "adjective" when they are used to describe a **noun**, and they are called an "adverb" when they are used to describe a **verb**. Unlike in English, the modifiers go _after_ the word they are modifying.

*   $pawo $mi $le $tope "My dog is good"
*   $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi $mi "I am eating my fruit"
*   $meja $ne $le $cina "This cat is small"
*   $meja $mi $le $makan $niju "My cat eats a lot"

### Genitive Particles

There are two particles that are used specifically for managing a chain of modifiers. They both allow you to group modifiers and they both cause the successive modifier immediately after the particle to be used in noun form. However, **je** only connects to the nearest noun (if that noun has a modifier chain in between, that's quite alright). Whereas, **wo** relates the connected noun phrase to the greatest open clause that it exists within.

N M M M M

"$huwa $inpali $hunsi $joli $cina" _"_little beneficial red flower seed"

*   "$huwa $inpali" flower seed
*   "$huwa $hunsi" red seed
*   "$huwa $joli" beneficial seed
*   "$huwa $cina" small seed

#### Using je

\$Noun\_

**$huwa je** $inpali $hunsi **je** $joli $cina "seed of the little-benefit red flower"  
a **je** is _isolating_ to just the most recent noun in the chain

*   "$huwa ($inpali $hunsi)" red-flower seed
*   "**$inpali $hunsi** ($joli $cina)" little-benefit red flower

#### Using wa

\$Noun\ \$Modifier\ je** $inpali $hunsi **wa** $joli $cina "seed of red flower of little benefit"  
a **wa** is _encompassing_ across the entire chain

*   "$huwa ($inpali $hunsi)" red-flower seed
*   "$huwa ($joli $cina)" little-benefit seed

Unlike the je particle, this one causes the collapse of any amount of open je phrases up to just returning to the root scope to describe the head noun again. Check out more info about this and other genitive relationships here: $Clarifying Descriptions.

### Force Modifier Derivation

You can force the modifier derivation of verbs and nouns by using the verb derivation of the base modifier $si. Click on the word to learn more.

### Changing State

We have the power to describe current state using $si, to describe a changing state, you can use the verb $pijen. Click on the word to learn more.

**Using Thematic Relations**
----------------------------

!$

**Thematic Relation Markers** are words that allow you to connect a **noun phrase** to the **verb** or "action" of the sentence by means of a (thematic) relationship. Each relationship is unique, thematic, and describes _what_, _why_, _when_, _where_ or _how_ the **noun phrase** is interpreted inside of the sentence (in relation to the **verb**). See the diagram for the thematic relation that each marker provides.

These words do not act like content words and (they cannot be derived into noun, verb, modifier forms) and content words can never work like thematic relation markers. You can place a thematic relation clause in any position in the sentence, although some thematic relations are more clear either prefixing or postfixing the main clause.

Using Particles
---------------

The glue holding sentences together are the grammatical particles. **Particles** are words that don't have meaning on their own, but are used to affect other parts of the sentence. For example, $le is a particle because it doesn't mean anything on its own, but it affects the next word. Kokanu uses particles like le and ta to modify the structure of sentences in various ways.

Using Connectors
----------------

Lastly, there are the connectors. **Connectors** are words that organize _multiple_ sentences, clauses or individual words together into a compound form with different connective meanings depending on which connector was used. For example, $un is a connector expressing that the multiple elements provided should be taken together or in addition to each other.
