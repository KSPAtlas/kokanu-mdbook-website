# Word Derivations

Kokanu's grammar allows for extreme flexibility when it comes to the vocabulary. Aside from a small set of grammar particles, any **noun**, **verb**, or **modifier** can be converted to one of the other two word forms using consistent rules. This system helps reduce the overall volume of words that you need to learn to become fluent.

Base Nouns
----------

Base nouns are very simple to convert into verbs and modifiers. When a **noun** is used as a **verb**, it just means the phrase "to be \[the noun\]". When used as a **modifier**, it becomes "of \[the noun\]" or "relating to \[the noun\].

*   As a **noun**, [nin](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=212&catid=8) means "person"
*   As a **verb**, it means "is a person" or "to be a person"
*   As a **modifier**, it means "of a person"

Base Modifiers
--------------

Base modifiers are also quite easy to convert. When a **modifier** is used as a **noun**, it becomes the **abstract object** of the **modifier**. Think of it like adding "-ness" to the word. When used as a **verb**, it also just means "to be \[the modifier\]" or "is \[the modifier\]".

*   As a **modifier**, [tanu](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=395&catid=8) means "cold"
*   As a **noun**, it means "coldness"
*   As a **verb**, it means "is cold" or "to be cold"

Base Verbs
----------

Base verbs are the trickiest of the three, but still not very tough. When a verb is used as a **noun**, it becomes the **generic object** of the **verb**: the most basic object you would normally interact with using the **verb**. For example, the generic object of "to sit-on" would be "chair" or "seat". The generic object of "to use" would be "tool". When used as a modifier, it means "\[generic object\]-like" or "resembling \[the generic object\]".

*   As a **verb**, [makan](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149&catid=8 "to consume (food)") means "to eat" or "to consume"
*   As a **noun**, it means "food"
*   As a **modifier**, it means "food-like", or "edible"

When used as a **modifier**, the idea of "resembling \[the generic object\]" doesn't necessarily mean resembling in looks. Rather, it requires considering what quality or qualities make that object unique in the context of its base verb. For example, the thing that makes food be food-like is that it is able to be eaten, regardless of how it looks. Something that is seat-like simply means that it can be sat upon (or maybe that it is intended to be sat upon), not that it has four legs and a back and looks like the stereotypical idea of a chair.

These rules apply to all content words in Kokanu. As stated earlier, there are some grammar particles, conjunctions, and prepositions that do not follow these rules but that is intentional as adding content word meanings to these words would reduce the comprehensibility of the language.
