# Kokanu Website
This is a website for Kokanu, the minimalist IAL.
The website is written in markdown, and supposed to be rendered with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
We have a custom preprocessor, that allows any Kokanu word appended with a `$` to become a link to our website's entry of that word. Use that extensively! (see how it used in other pages)
